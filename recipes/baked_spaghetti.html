                <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
                
                <li>1 (32 ounce) jar meatless spaghetti sauce</li>
                
                <li>½ teaspoon seasoned salt</li>
                
                <li>2 eggs</li>
                
                <li>⅓ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li> 

                <li>5 tablespoons butter, melted</li>

                <li>2 cups small curd cottage cheese</li>

                <li>5 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>

        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        
        <p>
            Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Step 2</h3>

        <p>
            Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender but firm to the bite, 
            about 12 minutes. Drain.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 3</h3>

        <p>
            Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir beef and onion in the hot skillet until meat is browned and onion is soft and translucent, about 5 to 7 minutes.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 4</h3>

        <p>
            Drain excess oil from the pan; stir in spaghetti sauce and seasoned salt.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 5</h3>

        <p>
            Whisk eggs, Parmesan, and butter in a large bowl. Add spaghetti and toss to coat.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 6</h3>

        <p>
            Place 1/2 of the spaghetti mixture in the prepared baking dish. Top with 1/2 of the cottage cheese, 2 cups mozzarella, and 1/2 of the meat sauce. 
            Repeat layers. Cover with aluminum foil.

        </p>

        <h3>Step 7</h3>

        <p>
            Bake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes. Remove the foil and sprinkle with remaining 1 cup mozzarella.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 8</h3>

        <p>
            Continue to bake until cheese is melted and lightly browned, 20 to 25 minutes.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 9</h3>

        <p>
            Serve and enjoy!
