        <h2>What is Doro Wat?</h2>

        <p>
            <em>Doro wat</em> (also spelled doro wot) is an Ethiopian chicken stew flavored with a spiced butter called niter kibbeh and berbere, 
            a spice blend that often includes fenugreek, hot chiles, paprika, cardamom, and coriander. Toward the end of cooking, hard-boiled eggs 
            are added to the stew. Doro wat is typically served with injera bread, a flatbread made with teff, the staple grain of Ethiopia. 
            It's one of the most recognizable Ethiopian foods and is served in Ethiopian restaurants around the world.
